# Analysis of the Psylect Trial: Home-Use tDCS & Digital Health for Depression

This repository contains the analysis scripts for a **phase-II compliant, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial** (ClinicalTrials.gov ID [NCT04889976](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04889976)) evaluating the efficacy of self-administered, home-use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with or without a digital health intervention for major depressive disorder.

The full study protocol is available [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14737175.2022.2083959).

> üìÑ Results from the primary analysis were published in [JAMA Psychiatry](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2813623)

> üìÑ Ancillary analysis on symptom clusters was published in the [Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.bjp.org.br/details/3592/en-US/effects-of-home-use-transcranial-direct-current-stimulation-on-clusters-of-depressive-symptoms--an-ancillary-analysis-of-the-psylect-study)
